Q&A
Will this projekt be updated in the future?
Yes-
This project will be updated in the future.


Will there be anything else like PTMod?
Yes-
There will be more programs like SFMod where your score will be saved somewhere else with a copy for security (maybe something like a cloud).

BIG Projekt-
In the end there might be another project called GAMMA LBMod, which will have its own website where you can compete with other players for a ranking, where you can see their profile and their equipment.

I hope for support, because it will also take a lot of time, it would be nice to get financial support to speed up the process, so I can work more on the projects.

My goal-
My goal is to make Stalker GAMMA a bit multiplayer...at least with LBMod and SFMod to bring the community a bit more together and have more fun!
