### **Q&A**
1. **Will this projekt be updated in the future?**
*Yes~*
This project **will be updated** in the future.

1. **Will there be anything else like PTMod?**
*Yes~*
There will be more programs like **SFMod** where your score will be saved somewhere else with a copy for security (maybe something like a cloud).

------------


#### **BIG Projekt~**
In the end there might be another project called **GAMMA LBMod**, which will have its **own website** where you can **compete with other players** for a **ranking**, where you can see their **profile and their equipment.**

I hope for support, because it will also take a lot of time, it would be nice to get financial support to speed up the process, so I can work more on the projects.

------------


#### **My goal~**
My goal is to make Stalker GAMMA a bit **multiplayer**...at least with **LBMod** and **SFMod** to bring the community a bit more together and have more fun!

For **more questions** or "***business***" here my **discord**: **beebuup**

**UI Update:** 02, june
##### **SFMod:** 01, july
