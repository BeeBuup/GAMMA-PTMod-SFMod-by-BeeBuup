Q&A
This project will be updated in the future.
There will be more programs like SFMod where your score will be saved somewhere else with a copy for security (maybe something like a cloud).
In the end there might be another project called GAMMA LBMod, which will have its own website where you can compete with other players for a ranking, where you can see their profile and their equipment.
